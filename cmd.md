These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## Step 1 - Create a Repository

A repository is usually used to organize a single project. Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets – anything your project needs. We recommend including a README, or a file with information about your project. GitHub makes it easy to add one at the same time you create your new repository. It also offers other common options such as a license file.

Your `hello-world` repository can be a place where you store ideas, resources, or even share and discuss things with others.

### To Create a New Repository

1. In the upper right corner, next to your avatar or identicon, click and then select New repository.
2. Name your repository `hello-world`.
3. Write a short description.
4. Select **Initialize this repository with a README**.

## Step 2 - Create a Branch

Branching is the way to work on different versions of a repository at one time.

By default your repository has one branch named `master` which is considered to be the definitive branch. We use branches to experiment and make edits before committing them to `master`.

When you create a branch off the `master` branch, you’re making a copy, or snapshot, of master as it was at that point in time. If someone else made changes to the `master` branch while you were working on your branch, you could pull in those updates.

This diagram shows:
* The `master` branch
* A new branch called `feature` (because we’re doing ‘feature work’ on this branch)
* The journey that `feature` takes before it’s merged into `master`
